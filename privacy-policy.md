**Privacy Policy for UAD-ng**

Last Updated: 2025-02-06

UAD-ng (the "App") is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal data is handled securely and transparently. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data that UAD-ng may collect, the purpose for which this data is collected, and your rights regarding your data.

By using UAD-ng, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 1. **Data Collection and Usage**

UAD-ng does not collect personal or sensitive information from users unless explicitly provided during the course of using the App. The data that UAD-ng may access includes:

- **ADB Data Access:** The app uses Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to interact with connected devices. UAD-ng does not collect or store any data from your device without explicit user permission. Any data fetched from the ADB, such as installed applications and disabled applications is used strictly for the purpose of functioning within the app and is not retained nor shared with any third parties.

- **Update Check Requests:** When UAD-ng checks for updates (both for the app itself and for the device list), HTTP requests are sent to GitHub servers. These requests are used solely to fetch the latest available updates and do not include any personal data or telemetry. The data sent is limited to the request necessary to check for updates and version information.

- **No Telemetry:** UAD-ng does **not** collect any telemetry data (such as usage statistics, error reports, or crash logs). There is no tracking of user activity or behavior within the app, and we do not share any data with third-party analytics services.

### 2. **Data Storage and Retention**

- **Local Storage:** Any data collected or used during the operation of UAD-ng, such as device data, installed applications, and aplication statuses are stored locally on your device and is not sent or uploaded to any external servers. The list of packages can be exported to the local file system by explicit and clearly labeled user action.
  
- **No Retention of Personal Data:** UAD-ng does not store or retain any personal data outside the scope of the current session. Any data related to ADB interactions is temporary and exists only as long as the app is actively running.

---

### 3. **Data Sharing and Third Parties**

UAD-ng does not share, sell, or lease your data to third parties. The app does not include any third-party services that would access or store your personal data.

---

### 4. **User Rights**

- **Data Control:** Since no personal data is collected by UAD-ng, there are no privacy rights related to the removal, modification, or transfer of data within the app. However, users are encouraged to uninstall the app at any time should they choose to stop using it.
  
- **Transparency:** Users are welcome to view the app’s source code on its GitHub repository and can independently audit the functionality to verify the app’s data handling practices.

### 5. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

UAD-ng may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through Discord and on our official channels (e.g., GitHub or official documentation). The updated policy will be posted on the official repository, and the effective date will be revised accordingly.
