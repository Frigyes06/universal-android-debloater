## Summary

This is a detached fork of the [UAD project](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater), which aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary and obscure system apps.
This can also contribute to improving security by reducing [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface). Read the [wiki](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation/wiki) for more details on getting started.
